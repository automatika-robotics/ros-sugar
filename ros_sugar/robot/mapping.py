"""Mapping capability descriptors.

A robot plugin declares *how* maps of its environment get built.
Mapping is a one-off, operator-driven activity that produces a file
on disk, so it is driven from the EMOS CLI.

A declaration is read through ``python -m ros_sugar.robot inspect``.

Two kinds:

- `VendorMapping` -- the robot ships its own SLAM, reached by running a vendor
  tool. The plugin supplies the argv and where the results land.
- `NativeMapping` -- EMOS maps the environment itself from the plugin's own
  LiDAR and IMU feedbacks.

A plugin that declares neither simply cannot be mapped, and the CLI says so.
