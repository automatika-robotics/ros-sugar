"""``RobotPlugin`` - the general-purpose robot plugin contract for Sugarcoat.

Plugin authors subclass `RobotPlugin` and, in a **declarative** ``init`` (no I/O),
populate ``transports``, ``feedbacks``, ``commands``, ``actions`` and ``events``. One instance is passed to a ``Launcher``.

Bring-up and tear-down are owned by `RobotPluginHost`, which the launcher attaches
to a plugin instance on the host side. Component subprocesses get a plain plugin
instance rebuilt from `RobotPlugin.to_spec` and use its consumer API.

If an author needs host-side setup that depends on the rclpy node (binding a
``RosServiceTransport`` is the canonical example), they override the optional
`on_attached` hook; the host calls it once after wiring is complete.
