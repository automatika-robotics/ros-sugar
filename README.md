ROS SUGAR üç¨ is a meta-framework that provides a whole lot of syntactic sugar for creating event-driven multinode systems in ROS2, using an intuitive Python API.

## Packages created using ROS Sugar

- [**Kompass**](https://automatikarobotics.com/kompass/): a framework for building robust and comprehensive event-driven navigation stacks using an easy-to-use and intuitive Python API
- [**ROS Agents**](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-agents/): a fully-loaded framework for creating interactive embodied agents that can understand, remember, and act upon contextual information from their environment.

## Overview

ROS Sugar is built for ROS2 developers who want to create event-driven systems with multiple nodes that are easy to use, have builtin fallbacks and fault tolerance, and can be configured started with an intuitive Python API. It provides primitives for writing ROS nodes and events/actions which can start/stop/modify the nodes, in the spirit of event driven software standard. ROS Sugar is also a replacement for the ROS Launch API.

A [Component](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/component.html) is the main execution unit in ROS Sugar, each component is configured with [Inputs/Outputs](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/topics.md) and [Fallback](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/fallbacks.html) behaviors. Additionally, each component updates its own [Health Status](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/status.html). Components can be handled and reconfigured dynamically at runtime using [Events](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/events.html) and [Actions](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/actions.html). Events, Actions and Components are passed to the [Launcher](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/launcher.html) which runs the set of components as using multi-threaded or multi-process execution. The Launcher also uses an internal [Monitor](https://automatika-robotics.github.io/ros-sugar/design/monitor.html) to keep track of the components and monitor events.
